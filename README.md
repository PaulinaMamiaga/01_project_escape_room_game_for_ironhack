# Project Title
# Quest: Escape Room – A Python Text-Based Game
## Developers: The POSH SPICE TEAM
### Ironhack Bootcamp - DTA PT Oct. 2025

## Project Definition (for GitHub)
### Quest: 
Escape Room is a collaborative mini-project developed during the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp (Unit 1 – Introduction to Python).
The **goal** of this project is **to build a text-based escape room game using Python, applying core programming concepts such as data structures, functions, flow control, and loops.**
- Players must explore different rooms, collect keys, and solve challenges to escape from the house. 
- **The game logic is driven by dictionaries and lists to store the rooms, objects, and game state.**
- The project was designed to reinforce teamwork, problem-solving, and clean coding practices in a real-world development setting.

## Core Learning Objectives: 
- Apply Python fundamentals (variables, functions, conditionals, loops).
- Use data structures (lists and dictionaries) to manage game states.
- Implement flow control to handle player decisions.
- Practice pair programming and team collaboration using Git and GitHub.
- Incorporate error handling, function documentation, and clean code principles.

## Game Summary
In Quest: Escape Room, the player wakes up in a mysterious house with no windows and must find a way out.
Each room hides clues, objects, and locked doors that can only be opened with specific keys.
Through exploration and logic, the player moves from the Game Room to the Outside, achieving freedom once all challenges are solved.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10+
- Google Colab (development)
- VS Code (development & local testing)
- Git & GitHub (version control)

## Team Collaboration
The project was developed in rotating roles:
- Dev Team: focused on coding the main game logic and structure.
- Research Team: explored Python modules, clean code practices, and testing strategies.
- Both teams worked collaboratively to merge research findings and code implementation, ensuring a robust and readable game.

## Deliverables
- main.ipynb — the main Colab notebook containing the game logic.
- .py files — exported Python scripts for reproducibility.
- A repository on Github for publishing the project.
- Google Slides + live demo
- A googledrive link (for summiting the project).
- Well-documented and modular code following PEP 8 and docstring best practices.

## Optional Features (Future Improvements)
- Add error handling with try/except for smoother user experience.
- Integrate *args and **kwargs for more flexible functions.
- Use regex to validate user input.
- Refactor the game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Create a simple GUI using tkinter or pygame.

## Presentation
- Duration: 5 minutes (3-min talk + 2-min demo)
